However, this structure cannot be easily captured by standard kernel functions. To model such structure, we propose expressive closed-form kernel functions for Gaussian processes. The resulting model, GP-LSTM, fully encapsulates the inductive biases of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent networks, while retaining the non-parametric probabilistic advantages of Gaussian processes. We learn the properties of the proposed kernels by optimizing the Gaussian process marginal likelihood using a new provably convergent semi-stochastic gradient procedure, and exploit the structure of these kernels for scalable training and prediction. This approach provides a practical representation for Bayesian LSTMs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and thoroughly investigate a consequential autonomous driving application, where the predictive uncertainties provided by GP-LSTM are uniquely valuable.',\n",
       "  'negatives': ['The complexity and detail of geometric scenes that are used in today’s computer animated films and interactive games have reached a level where the manual creation by traditional 3D modeling tools has become infeasible. This is why procedural modeling concepts have been developed which generate highly complex 3D models by automatically executing a set of formal construction rules. Well-known examples are variants of L-systems which describe the bottom-up growth process of plants and shape grammars which define architectural buildings by decomposing blocks in a top-down fashion. However, none of these approaches allows for the easy generation of interconnected structures such as bridges or roller coasters where a functional interaction between rigid and deformable parts of an object is needed. Our approach mainly relies on the top-down decomposition principle of shape grammars to create an arbitrarily complex but well structured layout. During this process, potential attaching points are collected in containers which represent the set of candidates to establish interconnections. Our grammar then uses either abstract connection patterns or geometric queries to determine elements in those containers that are to be connected. The two different types of connections that our system supports are rigid object chains and deformable beams. The former type is constructed by inverse kinematics, the latter by spline interpolation. We demonstrate the descriptive power of our grammar by example models of bridges, roller coasters, and wall-mounted catenaries.',\n",

Our technique is able to represent full 3D models including free and unknown areas. It is available as an open-source library to facilitate the development of 3D mapping systems. We also provide a detailed review of existing approaches to 3D modeling. Our approach was thoroughly evaluated using different real-world and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to model the data probabilistically while, at the same time, keeping the memory requirement at a minimum.',\n",
       "   'A string similarity measure quantifies the similarity between two text strings for approximate string matching or comparison. For example, the strings \"Sam\" and \"Samuel\" can be considered similar. Most existing work that computes the similarity of two strings only considers syntactic similarities, e.g., number of common words or q-grams. While these are indeed indicators of similarity, there are many important cases where syntactically different strings can represent the same real-world object. For example, \"Bill\" is a short form of \"William\". Given a collection of predefined synonyms, the purpose of the paper is to explore such existing knowledge to evaluate string similarity measures more effectively and efficiently, thereby boosting the quality of string matching.\\n In particular, we first present an expansion-based framework to measure string similarities efficiently while considering synonyms. Because using synonyms in similarity measures is, while expressive, computationally expensive (NP-hard), we propose an efficient algorithm, called selective-expansion, which guarantees the optimality in many real scenarios. We then study a novel indexing structure called SI-tree, which combines both signature and length filtering strategies, for efficient string similarity joins with synonyms. We develop an estimator to approximate the size of candidates to enable an online selection of signature filters to further improve the efficiency. This estimator provides strong low-error, high-confidence guarantees while requiring only logarithmic space and time costs, thus making our method attractive both in theory and in practice. Finally, the results from an empirical study of the algorithms verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.',\n",
       "   'Describing the content of an image is a challenging task. To enable detailed description, it requires the detection and recognition of objects, people, relationships and associated attributes. Currently, the majority of the existing research relies on holistic techniques, which may lose details relating to important aspects in a scene. In order to deal with such a challenge, we propose a novel region-based deep learning architecture for image description generation. It employs a regional object detector, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based attribute prediction, and an encoderdecoder language generator embedded with two RNNs to produce refined and detailed descriptions of a given image. Most importantly, the proposed system focuses on a local based approach to further improve upon existing holistic methods, which relates specifically to image regions of people and objects in an image. Evaluated with the IAPR TC-12 dataset, the proposed system shows impressive performance, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods using various evaluation metrics. In particular, the proposed system shows superiority over existing methods when dealing with cross-domain indoor scene images.',\n",

This class of neural networks implements a function tau(G, n) isin R m that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n onto an m-dimensional Euclidean space. We characterize the functions that can be approximated by GNNs, in probability, up to any prescribed degree of precision. This set contains the maps that satisfy a property called preservation of the unfolding equivalence, and includes most of the practically useful functions on graphs; the only known exception is when the input graph contains particular patterns of symmetries when unfolding equivalence may not be preserved. The result can be considered an extension of the universal approximation property established for the classic feedforward neural networks (FNNs). Some experimental examples are used to show the computational capabilities of the proposed model.',\n",
       "  'negatives': ['Computer-based learning systems can now keep detailed logs of user-system interactions, including key clicks, eye-tracking, and video data, opening up new opportunities to study how students learn with technology. Educational Data Mining (EDM; Romero, Ventura, Pechenizkiy, & Baker, 2010) is concerned with developing, researching, and applying computerized methods to detect patterns in large collections of educational data – patterns that would otherwise be hard or impossible to analyze due to the enormous volume of data they exist within. Data of interest is not restricted to interactions of individual students with an educational system (e.g., navigation behavior, input to quizzes and interactive exercises) but might also include data from collaborating students (e.g., text chat), administrative data (e.g., school, school district, teacher), and demographic data (e.g., gender, age, school grades). Data on student affect (e.g., motivation, emotional states) has also been a focus, which can be inferred from physiological sensors (e.g., facial expression, seat posture and perspiration). EDM uses methods and tools from the broader field of Data Mining (Witten & Frank, 2005), a sub-field of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence that has been used for purposes as diverse as credit card fraud detection, analysis of gene sequences in bioinformatics, or the analysis of purchasing behaviors of customers. Distinguishing EDM features are its particular focus on educational data and problems, both theoretical (e.g., investigating a learning hypothesis) and practical (e.g., improving a learning tool). Furthermore, EDM makes a methodological contribution by developing and researching data mining techniques for educational applications. Typical steps in an EDM project include data acquisition, data preprocessing (e.g., data “cleaning”), data mining, and validation of results.',\n",
       "   'Software inspections, reviews, and walkthroughs have become a standard process component in many software development domains. Maturity level 3 of the CMM-I requires establishment of peer reviews [12] and substantial sustained improvements in quality and productivity have been reported as a result of using reviews ([16], [21], [22], [27]). The NSF Impact project identifies the degree to which these industrial success cases have been instigated and improved by research in software engineering.\\n This research identifies that there is widespread adoption of inspections, reviews or walkthroughs but that companies do not generally exploit their full potential. However there exist sustained industrial success cases with respect to the wide-spread and measurably successful application of them. It also identifies research in software engineering that can be credibly documented as having influenced the industrial success cases. Credible documentation may exist in the form of publications or documented reports by witnesses. Due to the semi-formal nature of inspections, reviews, and walkthroughs, a specific focus is given to empirical research results as motivators for adoption. Through the examination of one detailed case study, it is shown that software engineering research has had a significant impact on practice and that the impact can be traced in this case from research to that practice. The case study chosen provides evidence of both success and failure regarding sustained application in practice.\\n Thus the analysis of historic impact chains of research reveals a clear impact of software engineering research on sustained industrial success for inspections, reviews and walkthroughs. More importantly, in impact chains where the empirical results have not been established, we conclude that success has not been achieved or has not been sustained.\\n The paper closes with (1) lessons learned for creating the sustained use and impact of semi-formal software engineering processes, (2) a request for researchers and practitioners to further consider how their work can improve the effectiveness of research and practice, and (3) a request to contribute additional success cases and impact factors to the authors database for future enhancements of this paper.',\n",

Contrary to previous work our system does not follow a generate-and-rank architecture.

Experiments on generating simple children’s stories show that our system outperforms previous data-driven approaches.',\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
