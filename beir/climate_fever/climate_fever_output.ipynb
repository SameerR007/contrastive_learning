       "  'positive': \"Global warming , also referred to as climate change , is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth 's climate system and its related effects . Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming . Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid 19th century , and in paleoclimate proxy records over thousands of years .   In 2013 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fifth Assessment Report concluded that `` It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . '' The largest human influence has been emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to for the highest emissions scenario . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing .   Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe . Anticipated effects include warming global temperature , rising sea levels , changing precipitation , and expansion of deserts in the subtropics . Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic , with the continuing retreat of glaciers , permafrost and sea ice . Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves , droughts , heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall ; ocean acidification ; and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes . Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels . Because the climate system has a large `` inertia '' and greenhouse gases will stay in the atmosphere for a long time , many of these effects will not only exist for decades or centuries , but will persist for tens of thousands of years .   Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction , adaptation to its effects , building systems resilient to its effects , and possible future climate engineering . Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) ,  whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change . Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0 C-change relative to pre-industrial levels , with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5 C-change .   Public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing . A global 2015 Pew Research Center report showed a median of 54 % consider it `` a very serious problem '' . There are significant regional differences , with Americans and Chinese ( whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO2 emissions ) among the least concerned .\",\n",

       "   \"Dr. Zeus Inc. , also known simply as The Company , is a fictional entity in a series of time travel science fiction stories by Kage Baker .   According to the stories , Dr. Zeus operates from the 24th century , using technologies of time travel and immortality to exploit the past for commercial gain . The immortality technology is limited to taking young children and turning them into cyborgs . The time travel technology only allows journeys into the past , and returns to the present . No artifacts or people can be brought forward from their own times . In addition , the technology is expensive and dangerous for normal humans to use .   History , or at least recorded history , can not be changed . Dr. Zeus can not save Lincoln , warn the Titanic , prevent the sack of Rome , or stop the burning of the Library at Alexandria . It can take valuable artifacts thought to be lost in these and other events , hide them and ` rediscover ' them in the future . However , even without the dangers of time travel , Dr. Zeus ' employees hate the past . By their time , all stimulants and narcotics are illegal , vegetarianism is compulsory , and they are disease - and dirt-phobic . They find the past 's inhabitants disgusting .   To carry out its mission , Dr. Zeus sends its employees far into human prehistory , where they take children from Neanderthal and modern human families and give them the immortality treatment . These individuals are then promised a bright future in the 24th century , in exchange for working for the Company till then . Their job is to preserve cultural artifacts , valuable plants , and endangered species , hiding them in safe places till the Company can ` recover ' them in the future . The cyborgs will get to the 24th century the old-fashioned way , by living through the intervening millennia . Along the way they can create others to help them , using children who would otherwise die and not affect history . They are also provided with many recordings of future culture , entertainment , and a carefully edited view of history . Dr. Zeus alone knows everything that will happen up till the 24th century .   As the series progresses , it becomes apparent that the Dr. Zeus story is itself a fiction . How they came by their technology , and how long the Company has really existed , is an unfolding mystery . Furthermore , not even Dr. Zeus knows what happens after July 9 , 2355 ; although it is possible to send messages to the past , there is nothing from beyond that date . This is known as the Silence , and is a source of dread to both Company people and cyborgs .\",\n",

       "   \"The Institute of Biology ( IoB ) was a professional body for biologists , primarily those working in the United Kingdom . The Institute was founded in 1950 by the Biological Council : the then umbrella body for Britain 's many learned biological societies . Its individual membership ( as opposed to the individual membership of its affiliates ) quickly grew ; in the late 1990s it was as high as 16,000 but declined in the early 21st century to 11,000 . It received a Royal Charter in 1979 and it held charitable status .  The IoB was not a trade union , nor did it have the regulatory power over its membership ( like the General Medical Council ) although it did have the right to remove a member 's Chartered status and was empowered by its Royal Charter to represent Britain 's profession of biology . In October 2009 , the IoB was merged with the Biosciences Federation ( BSF ) to form the Society of Biology , which has around 14,000 individual members and over 90 member organisations .

       "  'positive': \"Weather is the state of the atmosphere , to the degree that it is hot or cold , wet or dry , calm or stormy , clear or cloudy . Most weather phenomena occur in the lowest level of the atmosphere , the troposphere , just below the stratosphere . Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity , whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time . When used without qualification , `` weather '' is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth .   Weather is driven by air pressure , temperature and moisture differences between one place and another . These differences can occur due to the sun 's angle at any particular spot , which varies with latitude . The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric circulations : the Hadley Cell , the Ferrel Cell , the Polar Cell , and the jet stream . Weather systems in the mid-latitudes , such as extratropical cyclones , are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow . Because the Earth 's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane , sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year . On Earth 's surface , temperatures usually range ± 40 ° C ( − 40 ° F to 100 ° F ) annually . Over thousands of years , changes in Earth 's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth , thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change .   Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences . Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth 's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant . Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location . The Earth 's weather system is a chaotic system ; as a result , small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole . Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout history , and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns .   Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth . A famous landmark in the Solar System , Jupiter 's Great Red Spot , is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years . However , weather is not limited to planetary bodies . A star 's corona is constantly being lost to space , creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System . The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind .\",\n",

It is a large bear , approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear ( Ursus arctos middendorffi ) . A boar ( adult male ) weighs around 350 -- , while a sow ( adult female ) is about half that size . Although it is the sister species of the brown bear , it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche , with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures , for moving across snow , ice and open water , and for hunting seals , which make up most of its diet . Although most polar bears are born on land , they spend most of their time on the sea ice . Their scientific name means `` maritime bear '' and derives from this fact . Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice , often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present . Because of their dependence on the sea ice , polar bears are classified as marine mammals ; an alternative basis for classification as marine mammals is that they depend on the ocean as their main food source .   Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change , the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species , and at least three of the nineteen polar bear subpopulations are currently in decline . For decades , large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species , but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect . For thousands of years , the polar bear has been a key figure in the material , spiritual , and cultural life of circumpolar peoples , and polar bears remain important in their cultures .\",\n",

He is the first person exonerated through the work of the Georgia Innocence Project .   In the pre-dawn hours of October 25 , 1986 , a woman was attacked as she walked in the rain to a bus stop . The assailant hit her , dragged her to an embankment and raped her three times before she was able to get away and notify the police . During the incident , the assailant also stole her watch . Harrison became a suspect based upon a prior conviction for robbery and a tip that someone at his house was trying to sell a watch , although the victim 's watch was never found . Both the rape victim and the person providing the tip picked Harrison from a photo lineup . It was largely on this identification that Harrison was convicted on March 18 , 1987 , and sentenced to life in prison .   In February 2003 , Harrison sent a hand-written letter to the newly opened Georgia Innocence Project . `` Dear sirs , my name is Clarence Harrison . I am presently being held falsely accused of crimes I could not have committed , '' he wrote . `` I am seeking to vindicate myself by the only means I know how . '' Interns from Georgia State University College of Law and Emory University School of Law saw the letter as worthy of further investigation . After finding slides from the rape kit previously thought to have been destroyed , modern DNA testing proved that Harrison was not the rapist .   On August 31 , 2004 , DeKalb Superior Court Judge Cynthia J. Becker granted the DeKalb County District Attorney 's motion for a new trial and request that Harrison be released immediately . All charges were dismissed .   Three weeks after his release , Harrison married a woman who befriended him while he was in prison . Since his release , Harrison has worked to keep a positive attitude and help deter young people from crime .   The Georgia General Assembly compensated Harrison with a one million dollar sum payable as an annuity over twenty years . In March 2015 Harrison was bankrupt .

       "   \"Uncle Beazley is a life-size fiberglass statue of a triceratops by Louis Paul Jonas . It is located near Lemur Island in the National Zoological Park ( the National Zoo ) in Northwest Washington , D.C.   The statue is named after a dinosaur in the children 's book The Enormous Egg ( 1956 ) , by Oliver Butterworth , and a movie adaptation televised on the NBC Children 's Theatre in which the statue appeared . The book and the film , which aired on April 18 , 1968 , tell the story of a boy who finds an enormous egg laid by a hen that hatches a baby triceratops . The triceratops , named Uncle Beazley , becomes too big , so the boy brings him to the Smithsonian Institution . Beazley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History , but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo 's Elephant House because there is a law against stabling large animals in the District of Columbia .   The statue is one of nine dinosaurs of different species that Jonas designed and constructed for the Sinclair Oil Corporation 's pavilion at the 1964 New York World 's Fair in consultation with paleontologists Barnum Brown and Edwin H. Colbert of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and John Ostrom of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University . After the Fair closed , the statue was featured in Sinclair 's traveling Dinoland display .   In 1967 , Sinclair donated the nine dinosaurs to various American museums and the Smithsonian . The Smithsonian 's Uncle Beazley was initially displayed at the Zoo . In July 1967 , a crew from NBC-TV visited the Zoo to film the statue during the production of The Enormous Egg . After the filming ended , Sinclair donated the statue to the Smithsonian .   Uncle Beazley was present at the Smithsonian 's Anacostia Neighborhood Museum when the museum opened on September 15 , 1967 . From the 1970s to 1994 , the statue was located at the National Mall in front of the National Museum of Natural History . In 1994 , the statue was returned to the Zoo and was displayed in the former rhinoceros yard until 2003 , when the yard was renovated for the Zoo 's expanding Asian elephant family .   In 2007 , the Zoo and Smithsonian exhibits staff began work to restore the dinosaur . Zoo staff also created a garden exhibit for Uncle Beazley near Lemur Island with funding from a gift from a Director 's Circle donor in memory of her parents . The `` dinosaur garden '' features plants such as ferns , papyrus , and giant taro whose ancestors existed during the age of the dinosaurs . The statue was again refurbished in 2011 .   NBC 's telecast of The Enormous Egg also featured five smaller triceratops models that Louis Paul Jonas had created to represent the dinosaur during its youth . In 1979 , George Heinemann , the telecast 's producer , donated the models to Pittsfield 's Berkshire Museum , a Smithsonian Affiliate organization in Western Massachusetts . In 2014 , the five models , the largest of which bears the name of Uncle Beazley , were moved to Pittsfield 's public library , the Berkshire Athenaeum .\"]},\n",

       "   \"The Toronto Hunt Club was established by British Army officers of the Toronto garrison ( Fort York ) in 1843 . It held gymkhana equestrian events at various sites around the city . In 1895 it acquired its first permanent home in a rural area east of the city between Kingston Road and the waterfront . In 1898 the streetcar was extended eastward to the site , and soon the area became a cottage district and then streetcar suburb of Toronto . This forced the equestrian activities to move further afield . In 1907 the horses were thus moved to a site in Thornhill ( Steeles ' Corner at Steeles Avenue and Yonge Street ) .   In 1919 the club moved to a location closer to town at Eglinton Avenue and Avenue Road . Known as the Eglinton Hunt Club , a polo arena , clubhouses and other facilities were erected . The 1930s saw the club run into financial difficulties , however . In 1939 , with the outbreak of the Second World War , the large site was purchased by the federal government and turned into a secret Royal Canadian Air Force research facility , the No. 1 Clinical Investigation Unit . Noted scientists Frederick Banting and Wilbur R. Franks were employed there , and it was at the CIU that Franks invented the anti gravity g-suit . The club was also home to RCAF No. 1 Initial Training School , a unit of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan .   After the war it became the RCAF Staff School , and remained an officer training facility of the Canadian Forces until closed in 1994 . By 1998 the Government of Canada transferred the property to the Toronto Catholic District School Board and the Marshall McLuhan Catholic Secondary School was built there . The area surrounding the old Eglinton Hunt Club is now an established residential neighbourhood of Forest Hill .   The original Hunt Club site in Scarborough was turned into a nine-hole golf course in the 1930s , and it remains an exclusive private golfing club today .\",\n",

      "/tmp/ipykernel_202444/3105893467.py:3: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
