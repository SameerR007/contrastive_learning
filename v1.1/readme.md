## Description

- **app_average** - Average model
- **app_baseline** - Baseline model
- **app_effective** - Effective model
- **0.1 hyperbolic** - Model with alpha value = 0.1
- **0.5 hyperbolic** - Model with alpha value = 0.5
- **0.9 hyperbolic** - Model with alpha value = 0.9

### Note:
Alpha represents the weightage given to entailment loss minimization.
In effective model, similarity is calculated based on effective resistance.
